### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Name is Paulo Fernandes, currently working at a financial institution in Brazil, but not programming.

I've always been fascinated by statistics, and now I'm learning python and R so I can use some, as hobby or work.

Still trying to figure out some aspects of OOP, every other thing I've programmed in my life was procedural. Really liking it so far.

Hope I could collaborate soon in some projects!
